# Sneaky-Sneak-3
Basic text editor with cipher functionality

Sneaky Sneak 3 is a very simple text editor with the ability to encode and decode using ciphers. It is written in python 3 and uses the tkinter module.

the ciphers currently supported are:
  - ROT13
  - Atbash
  - Ceasar
  - vigenere

ciphers that are planned to be supported:
  - playfair
  - railfence

more than those will probably get added.
